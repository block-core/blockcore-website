<h1>Blockcore /// Platform</h1>

<h2>Node</h2>

<p>The node software is a full node software that runs the blockchain network. It is compatible with Bitcoin and
   utilized by other blockchains at the primary full node.</p>

<p>To build your own blockchain based on Blockcore you have two options; perform a fork of our primary source code, this
   is preferred if you need to radically modify the blockchain functionality.</p>

<p>The other way is to utilize our blockchain template, which is generated and relies on published on NuGet. This
   enables you to quickly and easily launch your own blockchain, and you will easily be able to get latest updates
   without messing with source code.</p>

<p>To simplify using our tools, we have made <a routerLink="/create-chain">instructions and generators available
      here</a>.</p>

<h2>Explorer</h2>

<p>Together with the Blockcore Indexer (below), we have made the Blockcore Explorer. If you have a normal Blockcore
   based blockchain, it is super easy to add support for your custom chain and deploy your blockchain explorer.</p>

<h2>Indexer</h2>

<p>Being able to look up blocks, transactions and addresses is an important part of any blockchain. It is very easy to
   add your own custom blockchain to the explorer.

   blockchain, including links to social media, forums, announcements, exchanges are more.</p>

<p>Blockcore Insight has APIs that enables third parties to get insight to the economy and state of your blockchain,
   including total supply and circulating supply of your coin/token.</p>

<h2>Decentralized Identifiers</h2>

<p>Blockcore is committed to supporting the ecosystem of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and the DID method for Blockcore is "did:is:". This is a work in progress.
