## What is Angor?

Angor is an innovative crowdfunding platform designed to leverage the power of Bitcoin and decentralized protocols. Unlike traditional crowdfunding platforms that rely on centralized intermediaries, Angor operates on the Bitcoin network and uses Nostr, a decentralized protocol for metadata storage and communication. This ensures that all transactions are secure, transparent, and censorship-resistant.

## Key Features of Angor

### 1. **Bitcoin-Only Investments**
Angor is focused exclusively on Bitcoin investments. Investors fund projects by committing BTC to a project’s wallet, making it a unique platform that caters specifically to the Bitcoin community.

### 2. **Fully Decentralized**
Angor stands out from other crowdfunding platforms by being fully decentralized. There are no central authorities or middlemen involved. All transactions are processed on the Bitcoin network, and project metadata is stored on Nostr, ensuring that the platform operates in a trustless manner.

### 3. **Staged Fund Releases**
Angor allows funds to be released to project founders in stages, based on predetermined dates and milestones. This ensures that investors’ funds are only used as the project progresses, providing an additional layer of security and accountability.

### 4. **Investor Control**
One of the most significant advantages of Angor is that investors can recover any unspent funds at any time. If an investor feels that a project is not meeting its targets or simply wants to withdraw their funds, they can do so without any restrictions.

### 5. **Enhanced Security and Privacy**
Angor leverages the latest in Bitcoin and decentralized technology to ensure that all transactions and communications are secure and private. The platform utilizes the Taproot Bitcoin update to provide conditional spending and multisig functionality, while Nostr facilitates direct communication between investors and founders.

## How Angor Works

### 1. **Creating a Project**
Founders create a project on Angor by providing the necessary details, such as the target amount, project duration, stages, and milestones. This information is stored on Nostr, ensuring that it is transparent and immutable.

### 2. **Investing in a Project**
Investors browse through the available projects on the Angor platform and commit BTC to the ones they find promising. The committed funds are then timelocked and released to the founder based on the project’s specified timeline.

### 3. **Fund Recovery**
At any point during the project, investors can choose to recover any unspent funds. This feature is designed to protect investors’ interests and ensure that they have control over their investments.
