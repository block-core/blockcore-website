### How It Works

  - Blockcore Wallet supports multi-signature transactions, allowing multiple parties to authorize transactions, adding an extra layer of security.

### Security Best Practices

- **Backup Your Recovery Phrase**:
  - Always securely back up your recovery phrase and store it in multiple locations if possible. This phrase is the only way to recover your wallet if you lose access to your device.

- **Enable Biometric Authentication**:
  - On mobile devices, enable biometric authentication to add an extra layer of security to your wallet.

- **Use Multi-Signature Transactions**:
  - For high-value transactions, consider setting up multi-signature wallets that require multiple parties to approve transactions.
